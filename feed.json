            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your dizziness and nausea have been labeled 'Vertigo', welcome to the club! You are not the 'Chosen One', but just another victim of vertigo. According to the research data, vertigo and balance-related problems are the most common health problems in the adult population, with women more likely to experience them than men. Almost 40% of U.S. adults suffer from vertigo at least once in their lifetime. Interestingly, it is not a disease in itself, yet a symptom bothersome enough to be considered lifestyle changing. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While vertigo presents itself as a manifestation of varying conditions, some of the common culprits are Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo(BPPV), Meniere's Disease, Viral and Bacterial Labyrinthitis,</span><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vestibular Neuritis, and Cholesteatoma. It is the result of problems with the vestibular system that regulates the balance, orientation in space, and posture of the body. Also, there are other neurological conditions like Multiple Sclerosis, Brain tumor, Stroke along with non-neurological conditions like low blood pressure, Migraine, Diabetes, and stress.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vertigo for some may be just a short passing symptom, yet for even them it certainly can be a disabling factor while making the performance of routine tasks difficult. As such their living quality gets affected negatively to a large extent. Along with treating the underlying conditions and certain precautions suggested by the doctor for an ongoing vertigo episode, there are ways to restrict it by making some holistic changes in your lifestyle. These simple changes will help dealing with vertigo and fortify your basic body systems like the vestibular and nervous systems that are causes of concern here. Let us look at these simple habits that can make your life lot better.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoga: Yoga comes in first, and with a significant weight on its side. Daily practice of a few asanas goes a long way in giving strength to your nervous system by regulating the blood flow to the head and other parts of your body. Healthy nervous system is a key to preventing dizziness and balance disorders. Also, Yoga is a stress buster which is again a trigger to the vestibular problems resulting in vertigo. Following are the noted asanas. Every asana has a link to a video showing how to perform it.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: During the vertigo attack, it is better to rest for some time when the severity is at its peak and wait for symptoms to subside. These Yoga postures should be part of your daily lifestyle to gain the utmost benefit and prevent the disorders from occurring. Also, if the vertigo is BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo), it would be sensible to go in the postures very slowly and avoid any jerky actions, especially with the neck and head.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eSeRjoolN2A\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shavasana</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Let’s start from the easiest and the favorites of the non-yogis. Shavasana, also called the 'Corpse Pose', induces the body in a deep state of rest. It helps in relaxing, reducing stress, regulating blood pressure, and managing sleep problems, all of which can trigger vertigo. Also, if you are dizzy and lying down is one position you feel comfortable, </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eSeRjoolN2A\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trying Shavasana </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or even deep breathing can bring you relief, sometimes almost instantly.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gX2eckMb6xU\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shanmukhi Mudra:</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This Yoga asana is magic when it comes to calming the mind and the nervous system. It helps in balancing the inner and external awareness, enhancing focus, and reducing anxiety. It is easy to practice and doesn’t require any kind of bending or jerky movements. Simply sit in any comfortable position and you are ready to </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gX2eckMb6xU\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">practice it</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/8VwufJrUhic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nadi Shodhan Pranayama</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Also called 'Alternate Nostril Breathing', it is a deep breathing practice that soothes the mind, body, and emotions, pulling you towards inner calmness. It circulates the blood throughout the body and brain, bringing out harmony. </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/8VwufJrUhic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Practicing it </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will help you feel centered which is good for enhancing the balancing awareness.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/T8sgVyF4Ux4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paschimottanasana</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This asana is a little challenging in nature and better avoided during a vertigo episode or early stage of recovery from the attack, but its routine practice is very effective in curing vertigo. </span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/T8sgVyF4Ux4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paschimottanasana</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a calming posture and helps with anxiety and depression that are triggers for vertigo. The beginners should find their comfortable version of this asana and let go of the desire to perform it perfectly. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1HbXt5ZRlg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salamba Sirsana</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Time for a headstand! Again, pass this one during the ongoing malady but try adopting it in your daily yoga practice. It's difficult but with time it can be done perfectly. Do take guidance if required for this pose. This variation of </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1HbXt5ZRlg\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">headstand </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">works wonders for the brain, heart, and the nervous system pulling blood to them. It is restorative for the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems and energizes the whole body.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2) Walking: We cannot stay away from a special mention to ‘walking’. Walk as you want to walk, slowly, briskly, or fast depending on how your body and energy levels permit that day. But walking is one of the easiest and most effective ways to stay fit. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walking becomes more relevant to vertigo victims as it is supportive of balance building. You are working your muscles, strengthening them, and boosting your blood flow throughout the body while walking. There are specific </span><a href=\"https://www.cigna.com/individuals-families/health-wellness/hw/vertigo-ug1288\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">walking exercises</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for vertigo patients to improve their balance. Practice them only after consulting your doctor.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3) Diet: What you feed your body is of utmost importance when it comes to managing symptoms like vertigo. Not only does a good diet help you do that but it effectively targets the underlying conditions to restore your complete body health. It's also about what you should avoid, to help your body recover fast and prevent the attacks from reoccurring. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us first start with some food remedies which can help you while you are experiencing the dizziness bouts:</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://breathingberry.com/media/posts/2/FinalFoodsforVertigo.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://breathingberry.com/media/posts/2/responsive/FinalFoodsforVertigo-xs.jpg 300w ,https://breathingberry.com/media/posts/2/responsive/FinalFoodsforVertigo-sm.jpg 480w ,https://breathingberry.com/media/posts/2/responsive/FinalFoodsforVertigo-md.jpg 768w ,https://breathingberry.com/media/posts/2/responsive/FinalFoodsforVertigo-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://breathingberry.com/media/posts/2/responsive/FinalFoodsforVertigo-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://breathingberry.com/media/posts/2/responsive/FinalFoodsforVertigo-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"1294\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://breathingberry.com/media/posts/2/FoodsForVErtigo-1.pdf\" alt=\"\" width=\"NaN\" height=\"NaN\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almonds: Almonds are good in any way they are eaten. You can roast them, eat as they are, or soak them overnight. What you need to avoid is seasoning them with salt. The easiest, tastiest, and boosted way, especially helpful when you are suffering from vertigo episodes, is to soak the almonds overnight, peel them, grind them and make a paste. Mix this paste with a glass of warm milk and drink it regularly in the morning (drinking it on an empty stomach is more beneficial, you can just lukewarm the milk or have it at room temperature if you face acidity or acid reflux problems). This helps you to overcome dizziness and makes the malady a little more manageable.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gooseberry and Coriander Seeds: Soak one tablespoon of coriander seeds and one tablespoon of gooseberry powder in a glass of drinking water overnight. In the morning, strain and add any kind of natural sugar (honey or jaggery), if required. Drinking this in the morning regularly helps in sudden fainting or the appearance of darkness before the eyes during a vertigo attack.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strawberries: Eat fresh strawberries every day during this condition. Adding a few of them to yogurt will help boost its effectiveness and if you like smoothies and shakes go ahead with a strawberry one but avoid adding sugars to it.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lemongrass Tea: You can try out this tea, especially at the onset of dizziness and nausea. It also helps reduce stress and anxiety, thus helping with anxiety-triggered vertigo. It's very easy to prepare and a fresh brew is much more effective. Consider including this tea in your daily diet. It's very simple to prepare. Just cut the stalks of lemongrass into pieces and pour boiling water over them. Allow it to brew for 5-6 minutes and then strain in the teacup for drinking. If it's summer time, you can let it cool down and add ice cubes to make it an iced tea.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ginger: Go ahead and make your favorite ginger tea or consume ginger in any other form you like. Ginger is considered to be great vertigo food which helps in alleviating lightheadedness and nauseating symptoms. I would recommend a lemon and ginger concoction with a little honey and black pepper for a perfect vertigo drink.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">     Now let’s move on to general diet recommendations for vertigo patients:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and strongly recommended is keeping yourselves hydrated. This is an important lifestyle change that you should seriously consider. Drink lots of water to maintain the fluid level in your body. Have a glass of lemon water or a cup of herbal tea or a glass of fresh fruit juice if you get bored of simple water.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay away from high sodium foods and even try to reduce salts in your daily diet. Sodium causes fluid retention in the body that aggravates inner ear symptoms and can give you dizzy and nauseating spells. Form a habit of checking food labels and staying away from high sodium and especially MSG which is a common trigger of vertigo. Skip sauces and dressing on your food and instead go for lemon, pepper, and natural seasonings like oregano, basil, paprika, etc.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limiting caffeine and alcohol is of high significance in a vertigo diet. They not only fluctuate your blood pressure but also stimulate your nervous system negatively which can lead to vertigo attacks. Also, drinking too much of them will put you at risk of dehydration. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay away from sugars. High sugar levels are a proven trigger of vertigo. Limit their use or stay away from them completely. Eat fresh fruits which are naturally sweet to satisfy your sugar cravings. You can use a limited amount of honey or jaggery but remember they are also a form of sugar and if you are already diabetic you need to be extra careful. Also, avoid white flour products like bread and pastries which quickly increase blood sugar levels.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must have heard of eating colorful foods and ditching the colorless. It's a simple but very effective way to practice healthy eating. Keep your diet full of fruits and vegetables. Some specific foods you must consider for vertigo are Ginger, Tomatoes, Eggs, Almonds, Herbs and Spices, Seafood, Whole Grains, Berries, Cayenne Pepper, and Spinach. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another must for vertigo patients is Vitamin D. Deficiency of the same can also trigger vertigo. So go have an outside day more often under the sun. Take your vitamin D supplements under the guidance of your doctor without fail.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4) General precautions for Vertigo Patients:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sit down or lie down if possible in a quiet, dark room when you feel dizzy and spinning is intense during the episode</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take precautions while performing head movements and do not jerk it in any way. Give yourself extra time for performing activities that involve triggering head movements like looking up or down or turning it sideways</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not get up from a sitting or sleeping position fast or with a jerk</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Squat instead of bending over to pick something up</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use cane or walking support during the episodes.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleep with the head raised on two or more pillows but consult your doctor about it first.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not go hungry anytime. Keep yourself well-fed and eat at regular intervals although you can regulate your portions every time.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hydrate, Hydrate, and Hydrate!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your vertigo episodes are intense and frequent, adapt you home for improving safety and avoiding symptom-provoking activities eg: placing the containers at eye level, avoiding the use of ladders, placing support near the toilet to hold while getting up or sitting down, placing a seater in the bathroom, etc.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn on lights when getting up at night to prevent falling</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask the doctor whether you should drive and take the suggestion seriously.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traveling Precautions: Take your vertigo medications with you or pre-medicate yourself as per your doctor, especially while flying and on long train or road travel. Arrive early at the airport or station and give yourself ample time for the proceedings. Do not hurry, as it can give rise to jerky movements triggering vertigo. Take help and support. You can avail the wheelchair facility as well during such times. Keep yourself well hydrated and well-fed. Take your neck pillow if prescribed with you always.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",
